The auth.ee.webseminars were conducted the autumn of 2011 and lasted until the early days of 2012.
Their main purpose was to make students familiar with developing web pages, and concentrated on html, css, php and lastly sql.
The seminar required the completion of five assignments plus one final which gathered all areas taught into the manifestation of one full blown web page hosted with front and back ends somewhere on the Internet.
This is my take on those assignments.
